the code for this is kinda wack, but feel free to use it for your stuff, though I havent organized it in a way for other people to use

- make a folder called "Nodes" in workspace
- put this script in serverscriptservice
- at the bottom of terrainGenerator.lua, you can see of an example of how I call the script, you will need to change the event up to suit your needs.
